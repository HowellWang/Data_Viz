<b>(Deceptive Visualization)</b>
### Motivation:

Marijuana is always a sensitive and controversial issue in the world and USA. As the first state that legalize the medical marijuana, Washington State's experiment must leave us large amounts of cases to study. So when I set about my deceptive visualization project, the social situations after legalizing marijuana becomes my first choice.

### Original Visualization: 
This is [original article](http://www.mcoscillator.com/learning_center/weekly_chart/higher_drug_related_fatal_crashes_after_marijuana_legalization/) I choose to deceptive. In that article, the author make such an argument that:

 * Higher Drug Related Fatal Crashes After Marijuana Legalization
